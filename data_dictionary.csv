"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",project,categorical,umbrella project under which these data were collected
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",survey,categorical,local site at which these data were collected
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",site_id,categorical,transect location at which these data were collected
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",date,yyyy-mm-dd,date on which these data were collected
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",sampling_bout,numeric,"sample iteration; when multiple of the same sample type were collected on the same day at the same survey location, bout number will increase incrementally"
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",dive_supervisor,"categorical, names",technician that served as dive surpervisor during data collection
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",collector,"categorical, names",technician that performed data colllection
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",hakai_id,5 digit numeric,"unique identifying number for bulk field sample. this number generally identifies a seagrass shoot, as well as all the diatoms, mesograzers, and epiphytes that will later become separate samples. In the absence of a physical field sample, the hakai ID is autogenerated based on metadata from the observation"
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",sample_type,categorical,"identifies between different survey types (ie. seagrass_habitat, seagrass_density, fish, invertebrates)"
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",depth,meters,"depth, in meters, at time and location of observation/sampling; depths are raw, and not corrected for tides at time of observation/sampling"
seagrass_density_survey,transect_dist,meters,distance along transect at which observation was taken
seagrass_habitat_survey,transect_dist,"categorical, numeric range","range of distances along transect observations apply to (ie. 0m - 5m, 5m - 10m, ..., 25m - 30m)"
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",collected_start,yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss,local time at which observations began for given sampling instance
"seagrass_density_survey, seagrass_habitat_survey",collected_end,yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss,local time at which observations finished for given sampling instance
seagrass_density_survey,density,integer,the number of Z. marina shoots found within a 0.25m x 0.25m quadrat
seagrass_density_survey,density__m2_,integer,the number of Z. marina shoots expected to be found in a 1m x 1m quadrat; an expansion estimator based on the 'density' variable
seagrass_density_survey,canopy_height_cm,"centimeters, integer",the average canopy height in an area; measurements are generally done in 5cm increments
seagrass_density_survey,flowering_shoots,integer,the number of flowering Z. marina shoots found within the quadrat
seagrass_habitat_survey,bag_uid,5 digit numeric,"unique identifying number for bag containing bulk field sample. this number generally identifies a seagrass shoot, as well as all the diatoms, mesograzers, and epiphytes that will later become separate samples. If no physical sample was collected, this field will be NA."
seagrass_habitat_survey,bag_number,numeric,"the non-unique bag number, used for tracking samplings until a unique identifier (UID) is added"

seagrass_habitat_survey,substrate,categorical,"dominant (and subdominant, if present) substrate type in vicinity of transect"
seagrass_habitat_survey,patchiness,"categorical, numeric range","estimated maximum patch size (m) between seagrass shoots (ie. < 1, 1 - 2, 2 - 3, 3 - 4, 4 - 5, > 5) "

seagrass_habitat_survey,adj_habitat_2,categorical,"coarse categorization of subdominant (if existing) adjacent habitat type, based on vegetation (ie. sand, seagrass, kelp standing, kelp flat)"
seagrass_habitat_survey,sample_collected,"TRUE, FALSE",logical variable; indicates whether or not a physical sample was collected
seagrass_habitat_survey,vegetation_1,categorical,subdominant vegetation found within area of seagrass transect
seagrass_habitat_survey,vegetation_2,categorical,sub-subdominant vegetation found within area of seagrass transect
