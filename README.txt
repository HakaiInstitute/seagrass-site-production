GENERAL INFORMATION

Title of Dataset: Seagrass site-level production 1.1.0

Abstract: This data package is a component of the Hakai Instituteâ€™s Nearshore research and monitoring program, designed to quantify change in seagrass ecosystems. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations. 

This package contains a core subset of the Hakai Nearshore seagrass monitoring data, focusing on key biophysical variables of the seagrass habitat.
