Hakai Institute Nearshore Program - Seagrass Site-Level Production Data Package v1.1.0

This data package is a component of the Hakai Instituteâ€™s Nearshore research and monitoring program, designed to quantify change in seagrass ecosystems. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations. 

This package contains a subset of the Hakai Nearshore seagrass monitoring data, made up of two .csv data files: seagrass_density_survey.csv for seagrass density surveys, and seagrass_habitat_survey.csv for seagrass habitat surveys.

For details on the methodology used in each of these surveys, please see the Hakai Seagrass Protocol found within this package.

For an explanation of each variable contained in the data files, please see the Data Dictionary found within this package.

For details on how this package and the data contained within have changed through successive versions, see changelog.txt.
