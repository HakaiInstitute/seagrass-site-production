# Data Quality Control Log
All notable data quality control measures will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v1.1.0] - 2023-01-12
### Notes ###
- This is a first attempt at keeping a data QC log in this format for this dataset

### Tasks ###
- Checked completeness of density and habitat datasets by aggregating data to event level and cross-referencing with events loaded from EIMS Hakai Data Portal to ensure that all site visits were included 
- Added missing flowering shoots data to raw data file 
- Corrected 2016 depths from feet to metres
- Corrected depths >10m (added missing decimal points)
- Converted all blank cells to NA and removed columns with all NA data
- Corrected all instances in both density and habitat datasets where multiple names were used to refer to the same thing for "surveyor" and "dive_supervisor"
